## About Laravel Assessement
This was a timed assessment, so things could have been better

This template was built to take a Laravel Assessement. Laravel is the framework. We are using Vue.js as the front end and Tailwind CSS for the style.

## How to run the project

Install Composer, and Node if not already installed.

Once the project is cloned, run Composer install and Npm install from the root of the project.

Now you can run PHP Artisan Serve to host the project.
